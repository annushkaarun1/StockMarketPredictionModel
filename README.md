# 📈 Stock Market Prediction Model

## 🚀 The S&P 500 Price Prediction Project uses machine learning to forecast the future prices of the S&P 500 stock market index using Python and the yfinance module💰💹

Built a machine learning model to predict the price of the S&P 500. Journey follows these steps:

Download Data 📊 – Using the yfinance package, we'll gather historical stock data.

Clean and Visualize Data 📉 – We'll process the raw data, handle missing values, and create visualizations to understand trends.

Set Up Machine Learning Model 🤖 – We'll configure an initial machine learning model.

Train Initial Model 🎓 – Our model will be trained on historical stock data.

Evaluate Error ⚠️ – We'll measure the model's performance using error metrics.

Create Backtesting Engine 🔄 – To better assess model accuracy over time, we'll develop a backtesting framework.

Improve the Model 🎯 – We'll enhance model performance by adding predictor columns and fine-tuning parameters.

## 📊 Data used
In this project, I used the S&P500 data csv file found in the repo
